name: "Speeduino v0.4 Universal ECU Mount"
version: "1.0.0"
vendor: speeduino
description: |
  A robust mounting bracket designed specifically for the Speeduino v0.4 ECU board.
  Features integrated vibration isolation mounting points and cable management slots.

  This mount elevates the ECU 15mm off the mounting surface to allow for airflow
  underneath and protects the board from direct contact with the firewall.

  Suitable for firewall, bulkhead, or under-dash mounting in any vehicle.

  notes: |
    IMPORTANT: Do NOT use PLA - it will warp and deform in engine bay temperatures!

    Printing recommendations:
    - PETG is the best balance of cost, printability, and heat resistance
    - ASA is preferred if you have an enclosed printer (better UV and heat resistance)
    - For high-performance or competition use, consider PA-CF for maximum strength

    Print settings:
    - 4 perimeters minimum for screw-hole strength
    - 40% gyroid infill provides good all-around strength
    - Print with flat side down - no supports needed
    - Use a brim for bed adhesion, especially with PETG

    Post-processing:
    - Remove any stringing from cable management slots
    - Test-fit M4 bolts before installation
    - Consider using brass heat-set inserts for repeated mounting/removal
